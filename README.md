# Faculty-Student Interaction Portal (Student Demo)

Hi, this is a small project . I made a basic chat demo using Socket.io and express.
This is not a full production app, but enough for the demo.

## How to run (quick)
1. Backend:
   - cd backend
   - npm install
   - node server.js
2. Frontend:
   - open frontend/public/index.html in browser (no build required)
   - it uses socket.io client CDN to connect to backend

## Notes
- I'm still improving auth, DB, file uploads, and frontend structure.
- If something fails, please check console for errors. I'm a student so small bugs possible :)

Regards,
abhishek
