Author: [Your Name]   Roll: [Your Roll No.]

Abstract:
This is a student-level demo of a portal to help faculty and students communicate, share files and chat.
This repo is small demo for the purpose of project submission.

What is done:
- Basic chat using Socket.io (backend + frontend)
- Simple in-memory message store (for demo)
- Basic README and docs

What is pending / TODO:
- Add authentication (JWT)
- Add DB (Postgres) and migrations
- Implement file uploads to S3
- Add assignment & submission flow
- Add role-based dashboards & permissions
- Improve frontend using React CRA or Vite
- Add tests and CI

Notes:
I tried to keep code simple so it's understandable during viva. There may be some rough edges.
